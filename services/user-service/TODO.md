## 1. Core Enhancement & User Experience

**Profile Picture Management**:

- The frontend uses the presigned URL to upload an image directly to your object storage (like S3, R2, etc.).
- The object storage, upon successful upload, triggers an event (e.g., via a webhook or a queue message) that is sent to your media-service.
- The media-service processes the image (e.g., creates thumbnails: small, medium, large).
- The media-service then publishes a user.avatar.processed event with the userId and the new avatarUrls.
- Your user-service is already listening for this event! The UserAvatarProcessedListener will catch it and call ProfileService.updateProfile to save the new avatar URLs to the user's profile.

**User Preferences/Settings**

- Add a new settings jsonb column to your profiles table in the schema.
- This JSON object could store things like:
  - theme: 'light' | 'dark'
  - language: 'en' | 'es'
- emailNotifications: { marketing: boolean, newCourseAlerts: boolean }
- Create new endpoints (GET /api/users/me/settings, PUT /api/users/me/settings) for managing these preferences.

**User Blocking System**
A necessary moderation and safety feature.
_Description_:

- Create a blocked_users table with blockerId and blockedId.
- When userA blocks userB, userB cannot see userA's profile, content, or interact with them.
- Your getPublicProfileById and searchProfiles methods would need to be updated to filter out any users that the current requester has blocked or been blocked by.

**Instructor Application/Approval Flow**
Right now, a user's role is set by an admin. You could build a flow for users to apply to become instructors.
_Description_:

- Add a status column to the profiles table (e.g., 'active', 'pending_instructor_review', 'suspended').
- Create an endpoint POST /api/users/me/apply-for-instructor where a user submits their application. This changes their status.
- Create an admin-only endpoint (POST /api/admin/users/{id}/approve-instructor) where an admin can approve the application. This would:
- Change the user's status to 'active'.
- Publish a user.role.changed event, which the auth-service would listen for to update the user's role in its own database. (This completes a two-way communication loop!).
