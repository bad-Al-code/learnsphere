# TODO:

- [x] Refactoring:
  - Deconstruct the monolithic CourseService into a clean, layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository, Client).
  - Improve authorization logic to be more explicit and reusable.
  - Enhance performance and reliability with better caching and event-driven patterns.
  - Implement our standard suite of professional tooling (Zod, Vitest, ESLint, Swagger).
